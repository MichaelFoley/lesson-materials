# APIS

Have you ever wondered how Google stores all of that data and how you can access that data so quickly? Have you ever wondered how Yelp stores all of that information on those establishments they list?


For this lesson we will be using TVMaze's API, which is a public API. Most companies will make their APIs public and available for developers to utilize and experiment with, but much of them require signup and information to give you a unique key to use in order to access that information (think of it as your unique password created by the company).

We will be using the TVMaze API since there is no signup required nor an API key required to use, so you can dive right into using it.
